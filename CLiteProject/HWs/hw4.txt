3.10) For floating point #s in sci. not., give a right rgular grammar; a regex; and a DFSA

S	->	digit M | M
M	-> 	digit S | digit A | A | S
A 	->  digit T | T
T 	-> 	digit A | M | digit

digit.[digit]x10[superdigit]

DFSA is just the grammar with circles...


3.16) 	S -> a | (T)
		T -> T,S | S

Draw left dependency graph; compute First for each nonterminal

S 	-> a
	-> T	<->	S

First S = a | T
First T = S

4.1) Python a) Needs a value no type
b) nope? at least not traditional overloading (you can make the functions _add_ etc do stuff)
c) Runtime
d) white space (indentation)
e) at the beginning before it's used

4.2) A) included in header files
b) not including header files, limiting the scope
c) if you need to overload it only in some methods/programs

4.3) Declaration are when you first introduce a variable to a program...Definition is the 
details for that variable...often needed before you can use it

4.5) a) you can coerce types?
b) functions can be overloaded if they take different arguments (or return something else?) because those will never do
the same thing 

4.6) r-values: 100, 0, 10^2; l-values: no i think all r values can be l values
