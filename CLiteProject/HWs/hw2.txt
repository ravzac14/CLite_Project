#1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.6, 2.7 && Draw a parse tree of clone.cpp

1.1) Eiffel is an OOP language designed by Bertrand Meyer and Eiffel Software. Strongly connected to the Eiffel
programming method. Based on design by contract, command-query separation, the uniform-access principle, the 
single-choice principle, the open-close principle and the option-operand separation.

Python is a general use, high level language. Emphasizes code readability and fewer lines of codes over more.
Supports OOP, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. Features dynamic type and automatic
memory management and has a large, comprehensive standard library.

Perl is a family of high level, general purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming languages. Developed by Larry
Wall in 1987 as a Unix scripting language. Borrows from C, sh, AWK and sed. Good for text processing.


1.2) A[i++] == step through the indices of an array, and therefore the values of an array


2.1) Digit 4 ( Digit 5 ( Digit 2 ( Digit 0)))

For an integer of length d, would take d steps 


2.2) (((Digit 4) Digit 5) Digit 2) Digit 0)

I think those two ^ are backwards :)


2.3) Letter a ( Digit 2 ( Letter i))


2.4) (((Letter a ) Digit 2 ) Letter i)


2.6) 	+				*
			*				+
				4				4
				3				3
			5				5	

2.7) 	+				*
			5				5
			*				+
				4				4
				3				3


clone.cpp parse tree...

int main () 
	int create
		a
		b
		c
		d
	int assign
		b
			a
		b	
			5
		d
			c
		c
			7
