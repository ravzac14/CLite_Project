Opps skipped lab 6 and just turned in lab 7...for this lab it looks like i parsed declarations, which was just
2 nested while loops for me (one for additional types and one for additional identifiers)

Also those annoying conjunction,equality,relation,etc methods which were just setting presedence for evaluating them
