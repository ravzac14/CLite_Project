x + y / 2
* could be evaluated arithmetically as both the same primitive type
* one could be implicitly converted and then evaluated arithmetically
* the operator could have been overloaded and would be evaluated later or differently
* the variables might not be compatible and you'd get a type error

No they would carry out and wrap around to the next int, resulting in like 0 or 1 (after subtracting 1) 
converting to float point you'd be able to get way bigger numbers with the exponent..

7.16 (design only)
a) default constructor would just creat an empty stack..otherwise maybe you could initialize it with something
on their. 
b) push would just drop something on top...with a check if the stack is full
c) this would  just be checks..asserting that the constructors work and that push throws an error if full, etc
