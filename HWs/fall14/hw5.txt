5.1) Integer (arbitrary), Int(fixed at word), Ratio/Integral (word), Float(word), double (double word), realfloat/complex(word)

5.2) is not convertible to an int in haskell, unless by function. is not useful, but easily implemented

5.3) logical tests should just be true/false..any other possible values confuse the evaluation

5.5) 0 00000001 0000000000000000000010 is 0.2

5.7) 

intToShow n	= print ascii version &&
	if n == pos. -> print 0s until power of 2 <= n (call it x), then print 1 and intToShow (n mod x)
	if n == neg. -> print 1s ""

5.9) big endian store the most signifigant byte in the smallest address, and the least sign. in the largest..
	little endian is the opposite. 

little = Intel x86
big = IBM z/architecture

5.14) 	char a[20];
		char b[20];

a = b has a couple problems..one it's looking at the memory address which they are not equal..to fix this 
one can do:

if (for all i, a[i] = b[i]) {return true;}
else {return false;}

or 

char a[20];
char b[] = a;

5.19) 

Struct = Declarations
